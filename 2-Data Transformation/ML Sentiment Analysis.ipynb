But how about the 'common' characters, like a-z? If you have a QWERTY-keyboard, you'd get key code <code>81</code> when you type <code>q</code>. When you have an AZERTY-keyboard, do you get code <code>81</code> when you press <code>a</code>, since <code>a</code> is where <code>q</code> 'should' be? Or is the mapping done differently?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>  <p>The answer I accepted is probably the best solution when you're capturing keys and want to be sure 'a' is really 'a', but as I explain in the comment underneath that, I still am curious how the key codes are 'translated' when using int'l keyboards.

For example, I have</p>  <pre><code>typedef std::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, persistent_alloc&lt;char&gt;&gt; pstring;  pstring a, b, c; std::string x, y, z; </code></pre>  <p>I want to be able to do things like:</p>  <pre><code>if (a == x)     a = y; c = z + b; </code></pre>  <p>and so forth, but by default it does not work, as <code>pstring</code> and <code>std::string</code> are unrelated types.  Now as far as the comparison is concerned, I can define:</p>  <pre><code>template&lt;typename Alloc1, typename Alloc2&gt; inline bool operator==(const std::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, Alloc1&gt; &amp;a,            const std::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, Alloc2&gt; &amp;b) {     return strcmp(a.c_str(), b.c_str()) == 0; } </code></pre>  <p>...and now I can compare strings for equality.  But adding these for every operation seems like a pain -- it seems like they SHOULD be provided by the standard library.  Worse, assignment operators and copy constructors must be members and can't be defined as global inline functions like this.</p>  <p>Is there a reasonable way of doing this?

Sadly, vague questions get vague answers, and the bottom line is that no one person on SO is going to write this code for you. You have a lot of research to do yourself. Here's a basic description of how I would get started.</p>  <p>First look into tying the app in with the camera. This is pretty easy, there's an intent you can call and onActivityResult you can receive the path to the file of the image they took.</p>  <p>The layout of your edit activity to edit the picture will have to have a Canvas object, and you'll probably need some buttons underneath or above it for them to pick their drawing tool.</p>  <p>The Canvas of the layout has to be implemented in a separate class, and it needs to implement runnable. This requires you making a <code>run()</code> function in the Canvas class, and inside of that you'll have a loop. Through each iteration of that loop, you'll clear the canvas, draw the picture using <code>drawBitmap()</code> to fill the screen, and then draw everything that the user has drawn.</p>  <p>Now, in the edit activity you'll have to implement a touch listener. This will require you making a <code>onTouch()</code> method that will give you a <code>MotionEvent</code> telling you where and how the touch occurred. Each time the screen is touched you'll want to look at the tools they currently have selected, and add it to the drawing that is painted on the Canvas.</p>  <p>When they're done, save the result of the Canvas. I am not saying that this is the best way to create the app that you have in mind, and I am by no means an expert. This is just a suggestion of where I would start thinking as a beginner.</p>  <p>Like I said, you have a lot to learn! I recommend searching for any terms you don't understand or widgets you haven't heard of that I mentioned, and looking at tutorials related to them. Somebody mentioned newboston and they're right, he has good tutorials.

Is there anything I can do with what I've got here to get it under 5 seconds? There's also a limit of 256 MB so as near as I can tell this is both the most time and memory efficient solution to the problem...</p>  <p>edit: The possible values for N and K are N &lt;= 10^9 and K &lt;= N, which is why I chose to do everything using BigInteger.  The maximum number of trials is 10000. So basically, you input the number of trials, then a pair of integer values for each number of trials, and the program computes the three versions of the binomial coefficient for the equation in the second loop. I figured it would be faster to read everything into the arrays, then process the arrays and put the results into a third array to be processed by the third loop because I figured it might be faster that way. I tried doing everything in the same loop and it ran slower.  </p>  <p>I've tried three or four different algorithms for calculating the binomial coefficient (nCr - or n choose r, all are different ways of saying the same thing).

Place a textbox in the GroupFooter. Set its datafield property to \"\"Country\"\" (same as that of groupheader). Now you need to set the following properties for the textbox:</p>  <ul> <li>SummaryFunction:- Count</li> <li>SummaryGroup:- GroupHeader1 (or the groupheader name you have in your report)</li> <li>SummaryRunning:- Group</li> <li>SummaryType:- SubTotal</li> </ul>  <p>You can also get the same results programmatically by using the following code.

Whenever you use the <code>yield</code> in a function definition, it becomes a <em>generator function</em>.  When generator function is used (called), it returns iterator -- you do not see it. Try the following <code>gen()</code> instead:</p>  <pre><code>def gen(n):     while n &gt; 0:         yield n         n -= 1    # decrement the value </code></pre>  <p>Then you typically use it in a loop:</p>  <pre><code>for x in gen(10000):     print x,         # comma to suppress new line </code></pre>  <p>If you have a function that returns your strings, just <code>yield s</code> instead of building the list.  Then call the generator function and collect only the values that you want (here not strings but numbers divisible by 100):</p>  <pre><code>lst = []   # init for x in gen(10000):     if x % 100 == 0:         lst.append(x) print lst </code></pre>  <p>The loop can be also replaced by so called list comprehension:</p>  <pre><code>lst = [ x for x in gen(10000) if x % 100 == 0 ] print lst </code></pre>  <p>...which is more understandable (i.e. resembles the above loop) when you write the same like that:</p>  <pre><code>lst = [ x          for x in gen(10000)              if x % 100 == 0 ] print lst </code></pre>  <p>But you can use a generator function wherever a sequence is expected.

This means you either have to attach them again using merge or prevent them from being detached.</p>  <p>The most likely reason for them becoming detached is the end of the transaction they were part of. Assuming you are using JTA and did nothing extra then if addUser is not a method of an EJB while groupDao is an EJB then the transaction starts with the groupDao.find call and ends the moment find returns. Because by default an EJB method starts a transaction if not one is already running. If addUser is a method of an EJB things should be fine because then addUser will start the transaction and groupDao.find will use the existing transaction so everything happens in one transaction. </p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>1.0</td><td>java</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>I recently got into node and I installed it on my localhost.

We sequentially allocate space to the stacks and we link new blocks to the previous block. This means any new element in a stack keeps a pointer to the previous top element of that particular stack. In this implementation, we face a problem of unused space. For example, if a stack deletes some of its elements, the deleted elements may not necessarily appear at the end of the array. So, in that case, we would not be able to use those newly freed spaces. To overcome this deficiency, we can maintain a free list and the whole array space would be given initially to the free list. For every insertion, we would delete an entry from the free list. In case of deletion, we would simply add the index of the free cell to the free list. In this implementation we would be able to have flexibility in terms of variable space utilization but we would need to increase the space complexity.</p>  <pre><code>1 int stackSize = 300; 2 int indexUsed = 0; 3 int[] stackPointer = {-1,-1,-1}; 4 StackNode[] buffer = new StackNode[stackSize * 3];  5 void push(int stackNum, int value) { 6     int lastIndex = stackPointer[stackNum]; 7     stackPointer[stackNum] = indexUsed; 8     indexUsed++; 9     buffer[stackPointer[stackNum]]=new StackNode(lastIndex,value); 10 }  11 int pop(int stackNum) { 12    int value = buffer[stackPointer[stackNum]].value; 13    int lastIndex = stackPointer[stackNum]; 14    stackPointer[stackNum] = buffer[stackPointer[stackNum]].previous; 15    buffer[lastIndex] = null; 16    indexUsed--; 17    return value; 18 }  19 int peek(int stack) { return buffer[stackPointer[stack]].value; }  20 boolean isEmpty(int stackNum) { return stackPointer[stackNum] == -1; } 21 22 class StackNode { 23    public int previous; 24    public int value; 25    public StackNode(int p, int v){ 26       value = v; 27       previous = p; 28    } 29 } </code></pre>  <p>my question is: in the mothod pop(), after setting buffer[lastIndex] to null(line 15), then indexUsed--(line 16), will the indexUsed be the head of the empty space?  let's call the <strong>Stack Top nodes of</strong> first stack : S1, second stack : S2, third stack : S3; what happens if:  I have s1 followed by s2 and s3 pushed before I wanted to pop s1,</p>  <pre><code>index:    10   11   12    13 ------------------------------- | ...   | s1 | s2 | s3 | null | ------------------------------- </code></pre>  <p>the <strong>indexUsed</strong> is now 13.

In general, if you route everything through one init method, your don't have to worry about duplicating code across all the other convenience init methods that you might want to offer.</p>  <p>It also lets you know which init method you should call on the superclass when you want to create a subclass. (Your third init method, <code>initWithNibName...</code> violates this rule, actually. Instead of calling the superclass's designated initializer, you're just calling <code>init</code>.)</p>  <p>In your case, declaring an initializer with the method signature <code>initWithFullScreen:(BOOL)fullScreen</code> and designating it the designated initializer is probably the way to go. And within that you make sure you call the superclass's designated initializer, which you are.</p>  <p>You could then create convenience initializers: <code>initWithFullScreen</code> and <code>initWithoutFullScreen</code> if you wanted to; they would both just call your designated initializer. For example:</p>  <pre><code>- (id)initWithoutFullScreen {     return [self initWithFullScreen:NO]; } </code></pre>  <p>So, it's OK to break the convention. You may have your reasons. But it's generally easier to keep your code organized if you stick to it.</p>  <h3>Amendment</h3>  <p>For extra credit, consider the NSCoding protocol, which requires classes to have an <code>initWithCoder:</code> method. One might say it violates the rule, since classes which adopt NSCoding and whose superclasses also adopt NSCoding must be prepared to have two paths to initialization: an <code>initWithCoder:</code> method which calls <code>[super initWithCoder:coder]</code> and the regular designated initializer.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>4.0</td><td>php</td></tr><tr><td><p>If you're just building an <em>iPhone</em> app, then by all means choose Objective C.

In C++, an integer is allowed as the if condition.  One big reason for this is to maintain compatibility with C - in C, there is no boolean type, so integers are perfectly valid if conditions.</p>  <p>You may ask: Why does Java disallow integers as if conditions?  One very important reason to do this is to stop a common bug.  It's common to write</p>  <pre><code>if (x = 10) </code></pre>  <p>while actually meaning</p>  <pre><code>if (x == 10) </code></pre>  <p>In fact, this is so common that many C/C++ programmers write</p>  <pre><code>if (10 == x) </code></pre>  <p>instead, just so it's harder to write an accidental assignment.</p>  <p>If you really do mean to perform an assignment, you can always write</p>  <pre><code>x = 10; // ... </code></pre>  <p>because <code>x = 10</code> is always nonzero and thus the C++ version will always enter the if.  This way, you don't really lose expressiveness but do prevent a bug.</p>  <hr>  <p>Also, you write</p>  <pre><code>int x; //uninitalized variable which is null if () {     // ... } </code></pre>  <p>I think you mean to write <code>if (x)</code>, but that's beside the point.  An uninitialized variable is <strong>NOT</strong> null in C, C++, or Java!  Java doesn't allow you to use an uninitialized local (and fields are automatically initialized), so you can never use an uninitialized variable in Java.  In C/C++, an uninitialized variable <em>may</em> be null, but there is no guarantee whatsoever of that.  Instead, the value of an uninitialized variable is undefined, and is likely whatever previously executed code left on the stack.  <strong>DO NOT</strong> depend on an uninitialized variable being null - it will absolutely come back to bite you.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>7.0</td><td>c++</td></tr><tr><td><p>I am programming a push button to start the software in a linux based board.

For each checked exception which is a possible result,   the throws clause for the method (§8.4.6) or constructor (§8.8.5) must   mention the class of that exception or one of the superclasses of the   class of that exception. This compile-time checking for the presence   of exception handlers is designed to reduce the number of exceptions   which are not properly handled.</p>      <p>The unchecked exceptions classes are the class RuntimeException and   its subclasses, and the class Error and its subclasses. All other   exception classes are checked exception classes. The Java API defines   a number of exception classes, both checked and unchecked. Additional   exception classes, both checked and unchecked, may be declared by   programmers. See §11.5 for a description of the exception class   hierarchy and some of the exception classes defined by the Java API   and Java virtual machine.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So basically it looks at the code, if it comes across an exception, looks up the inheritance hierarchy of the exception to decide  if it is checked or unchecked.</p>  <p><a href=\"\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/exceptions.html\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Read</a></p> \"</td><td>NULL</td><td>7.0</td><td>c++</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>If you are using ADO.Net then read <a href=\"\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bh8kx08z.aspx\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Populating A DataSet from a DataAdapter (ADO.Net)</a> and <a href=\"\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/tf579hcz.aspx\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Generating Commands With CommandBuilders (ADO.Net)</a>.</p> \"</td><td>NULL</td><td>59.0</td><td>hibernate</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>I can't find a way to make a file available to download using silverlight.

Your archived app does not store the provisioning profile in its archive. You merely tell it what provisioning profile to look for in order to determine if it can run on a certain device. Therefore you can change your provisioning profiles all you want, and as long as it is the same profile the app is told to look for, you never have to recompile the app to recognize new devices.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>12.0</td><td>asp.net</td></tr><tr><td><p>I have an issue in my use of critical sections.  My app has a large number of threads, say 60, which all need access to a global resource.  I therefore protect that resource with a critical section.  This works perfectly during operation, however when my application shuts down, I trigger the threads to quit, and then destroy the critical section.</p>  <p>The problem comes if some of those threads are waiting on the critical section at exit time, and thus are blocked from quitting themselves.</p>  <p>I've written a wrapper around the windows CriticalSection calls that has an 'Initialised' flag, which I set to true when the crit is created, and set to false when I'm about to leave the crit (both cases are set when inside the crit).  This flag is checked before the 'enter crit' wrapper function tries entering the crit, bypassing the request if the flag is false.  The flag is also checked the moment any thread successfully enters the crit, making it immediately leave the crit if it's false.</p>  <p>What I to do prior to deleting the crit is set the flag to false, then wait for any waiting threads to: be allowed into the crit; see the Initialised flag is false; then leave the crit (which should be a pretty quick operating for each thread).</p>  <p>I check the number of threads waiting for access to the crit by checking the LockCount inside the CRITICAL_SECTION struct, and waiting until it hits 0 (in XP, that's <code>LockCount - (RecursionCount-1)</code>; in 2003 server and above, the lock count is <code>((-1) - (LockCount)) &gt;&gt; 2</code>), before I then destroy the critical section.</p>  <p>This <em>should</em> be sufficient, however I'm finding that the LockCount reaches 0 when there's still one thread (always just one thread, never more) waiting to enter the crit, meaning if I delete the crit at that point, the other thread subsequently wakes up from waiting on the crit, and causes a crash as the CRITICAL_SECTION object has by that time been destroyed.</p>  <p>If I keep my own internal lock count of threads waiting for access, I have the correct count; however this isn't ideal as I have to increment this count outside of the crit, meaning that value isn't protected and therefore can't be entirely relied upon at any one time.</p>  <p>Does anyone know why the LockCount in the CRITICAL_SECTION struct would be out by 1?  If I use my own lock count, then check the CRITICAL_SECTION's lock count <em>after</em> that last thread has exited (and before I destroy the crit), it's still 0...</p>  <p>Or, is there a better way for me to protect the global resource in my app with that many threads, other than a critical section?</p>  <p>This is my wrapper struct:</p>  <pre><code>typedef struct MY_CRIT {     BOOL Initialised;     CRITICAL_SECTION Crit;     int MyLockCount; } </code></pre>  <p>Here's my Crit init function:</p>  <pre><code>BOOL InitCrit( MY_CRIT *pCrit ) {     if (pCrit)     {         InitializeCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );                   pCrit-&gt;Initialised = TRUE;         pCrit-&gt;MyLockCount = 0;         return TRUE;     }     // else invalid pointer     else             return FALSE; } </code></pre>  <p>This is my enter crit wrapper function:</p>  <pre><code>BOOL EnterCrit( MY_CRIT *pCrit ) {     // if pointer valid, and the crit is initialised     if (pCrit &amp;&amp; pCrit-&gt;Initialised)     {         pCrit-&gt;MyLockCount++;         EnterCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );         pCrit-&gt;MyLockCount--;          // if still initialised         if (pCrit-&gt;Initialised)         {             return TRUE;         }         // else someone's trying to close this crit - jump out now!         else         {             LeaveCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );             return FALSE;         }     }     else // crit pointer is null         return FALSE; } </code></pre>  <p>And here's my FreeCrit wrapper function:</p>  <pre><code>void FreeCrit( MY_CRIT *pCrit ) {     LONG    WaitingCount = 0;      if (pCrit &amp;&amp; (pCrit-&gt;Initialised))     {         // set Initialised to FALSE to stop any more threads trying to get in from now on:         EnterCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );         pCrit-&gt;Initialised = FALSE;         LeaveCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );          // loop until all waiting threads have gained access and finished:         do {             EnterCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );              // check if any threads are still waiting to enter:             // Windows XP and below:             if (IsWindowsXPOrBelow())             {                 if ((pCrit-&gt;Crit.LockCount &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; ((pCrit-&gt;Crit.RecursionCount - 1) &gt;= 0))                     WaitingCount = pCrit-&gt;Crit.LockCount - (pCrit-&gt;Crit.RecursionCount - 1);                 else                     WaitingCount = 0;             }             // Windows 2003 Server and above:             else             {                 WaitingCount = ((-1) - (pCrit-&gt;Crit.LockCount)) &gt;&gt; 2;             }                          // hack: if our own lock count is higher, use that:             WaitingCount = max( WaitingCount, pCrit-&gt;MyLockCount );              // if some threads are still waiting, leave the crit and sleep a bit, to give them a chance to enter &amp; exit:             if (WaitingCount &gt; 0)             {                 LeaveCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );                 // don't hog the processor:                 Sleep( 1 );             }             // when no other threads are waiting to enter, we can safely delete the crit (and leave the loop):             else             {                 DeleteCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );             }         } while (WaitingCount &gt; 0);     } } </code></pre> </td><td><c><winapi><critical-section></td><td>0.0</td><td>c#</td></tr><tr><td><p>I need to check how good the result of one image registration process' was.

And most time return no result..</p>  <p>2) If i'm to search in several tables how can I acheive this.</p>  <p>Thanks for you time and patience.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <p>Assuming i have the following tables in my db</p>  <pre><code> about Table       about_id      about_head      about_content      about_tags      about_created    about_cs Table       about_cs_id      about_cs_head      about_cs_content      about_cs_tags      about_cs_created    home Table       home_id      home_head      home_content      home_tags      home_created </code></pre>  <p>I'm planning to have different criteria for the users to base their search on..</p>  <p>Search By Date: ( Date picker... Date will be queried against the date a particular article was created. In all the tables )</p>  <p>Search by Tags: ( A single (one or two) word search to search all the tables with a tag column in it )</p>  <p>Search Main Article: ( this is where the user will be allowed to enter any type of search query (string) and it'll be search for in the all the tables that have a content field in it )</p>  <p>So if the User enters a word like \"\"The Most Famous Church In South Bend\"\".... Do I just search for thw whole string </p>  <pre><code>   LIKE % ' .$searchString.

As the following code will show - I have ViewModel that updates a ObservableCollection Property bound to a View. Normally I would update the collection from a result retrieved from a Model, but hopefully this example will suffice. </p>  <pre><code>using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Collections.ObjectModel; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading; using System.Windows.Controls;  namespace MVVMWpf.ViewModel {     public class ListViewModel     {          public ObservableCollection&lt;int&gt; SomeObjectCollection { get; set; }          public ListViewModel()         {              SomeObjectCollection = new ObservableCollection&lt;int&gt;();          }          public void Do()         {              for (int i = 1; i &lt; 1000000; i++)              {                  int i1 = i;                  SomeObjectCollection.Add(i1);              }         }      } } </code></pre>  <p>Unfortunately, this blocks this UI. It will only update the View when loop runs to completion. The way I solved it breaks MVVM concepts. That's why I need your help. I did it this way.</p>  <pre><code>public class ListViewModel {     private delegate void LongRunningProcess();     public ObservableCollection&lt;int&gt; SomeObjectCollection { get; set; }     private ListBox listBox;     public ListViewModel(ListBox listBox)     {         this.listBox = listBox;         SomeObjectCollection = new ObservableCollection&lt;int&gt;();      }      public void Do()     {         Thread thread = new Thread(() =&gt;         {            for (int i = 1; i &lt; int.MaxValue; i++)            {                int i1 = i;                listBox.Dispatcher.Invoke(                    new LongRunningProcess(() =&gt;                    SomeObjectCollection.Add(i1);                  }});          thread.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);         thread.Start();     }  } </code></pre>  <p>As you can see the ViewModel now knows about the listBox element from the UI. And looking at the MVVM diagram only the View should have a reference to the ViewModel through binding. How does one overcome this issue?

Then when decrypting, base64-decode the input string to get back the ciphertext bytes, do the XOR to get your plaintext bytes, and then create the plaintext string from the plaintext bytes by interpreting the plaintext bytes as a UTF-16LE sequence.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Updated to reply to a comment below without having to worry about running out of space.</em></p>  <p>As I said, you could base64-encode the ciphertext bytes.  That's certainly doable in Java.  The commons-codec library has methods to do it and a search will find others.  If you're not allowed to use outside libraries, then roll your own method of converting arbitrary bytes to bytes guaranteed to be a valid encoding of something.</p>  <p>For example, you could split each byte in your ciphertext into its high 4 bits and low 4bits.  Thus each byte would produce a pair of values that each range from 0-15.  Then you could produce a 2-byte sequence from each byte by adding the ASCII code for <code>'A'</code> to those numbers.

This object would already be in memory and not need to go back to the database to service requests.</li> <li>An <code>update()</code> method on UOM would allow event or timing based triggers to ask for the UOM object to update itself.</li> </ol>  <p>This is just one example of where there is a some relatively static set of data that is used regularly by service requests and the repeated querying of the database would be wasteful.

Jython runs on the JVM (Java virtual machine) and IronPython runs on the CLR (common language runtime). This means that programs using these implementations can take advantage of the libraries and ecosystem of the virtual machines. For example, using Jython, I can write a plugin for a Java application, and using IronPython I can use the .NET standard library. The downside to using a different implementation to CPython is that CPython is the most used python, and therefore has the best support from libraries and developers.

Since you're looking to test whether a point (x0, y0) is left-of a given surface (your polyline), you need to identify which segment to test against by its height. One easy way to do this would be to build a tree of the lower point of each segment, and search in that for the test point's predecessor. Once you have that segment, you can do your left-of test directly: if it's left of both endpoints, or between them on the appropriate side, then you return true.</p>  <p>I am assuming here that you guarantee that the vertical extent of your polyline is greater than where you might find your query point, and that the line doesn't overlap itself vertically. The latter assumption might be quite poor.</p>  <p>Expansion in response to OP's comment:</p>  <p>Note that the angle example in the question contradicts the first assumption - the polyline does not reach the height of the search point.</p>  <p>One way to conceptualize my method is by sorting your segments vertically, and then iterating through them comparing your point's y-coordinate against the segments until your point is above the lower endpoint and below the higher endpoint. Then, use the endpoints of the segment to figure out the x-intercept at the given y. If the point has a lower x-cooordinate, it's to the left, and if it has a greater x-coordinate, it's to the right. </p>  <p>There are two ways to improve on this explanation in a real implementation, one of which I mentioned about:</p>  <ol> <li>Use a balanced search tree to find the right segment instead of iterating through a sorted list, to bring the time from <code>O(n)</code> to <code>O(log n)</code></li> <li>Reconceptualize the search as finding the intersection of the polyline and the horizontal line y = y0 through the search point.

In C++, a multidimensional array variable is itself a single gigantic array, created instantly, with its multidimensional nature only being syntactic sugar.  In C++, you have to initialize all but the first index of an array in order to tell the compiler how to convert between your multidimensional array syntax and the single gigantic array that it is actually using behind the scenes.</p>  <p>You can get more Java-like behavior in C++ by initializing a multidimensional array as a pointer to an array of pointers to arrays, instead of simply as an array of arrays (objects in Java are mostly equivalent to pointers to objects in C++).

Let's for example that I have several pages, each one with each own identification (ie. id=1, id=5). Furthermore, let's assume that for each one of those id I have a row in the database:</p>  <p>So in short, what I want to achieve is: Pushing database changes in-directly to specific clients on specific pages while taking advantage of web sockets (persistent connection).</p>  <p>for example:</p>  <p><strong>Row 1:</strong></p>  <p>id = 1</p>  <p>name = myname1</p>  <p><strong>Row 2:</strong></p>  <p>id = 2</p>  <p>name = myname2</p>  <p>What I want to do is that when the specific row or even a specific value in a column changes, it will trigger an event that can send a specific data to ONLY those clients that are visiting the page with a specific id that was changed.</p>  <p>for example: if row 1 column name changed from 'name1' to 'name2', and the ID of the primary key is 5, I want all those who visit the page with id=5 to recieve an event in the client side.</p>  <p>I want to prevent myself for developing a client code that will contentiously send requests to a webservice and query that specific row by id to see if it was update or a specific column value was changed. </p>  <p>One solution that I thought about is to keep the key/value in memory (ie. memcache) like the key represents the id and the value will be the datetime lst updated. Then I can query the memory and if, for example, [5, 05/11/2012 12:03:45] I can know if they data was last updated by saving the last time I queries the memory in the client side, and compare the dates. If the client datetime value is older than the one in the key/value in the memory, then I would query the database again.</p>  <p>However, it's still a passive approach.</p>  <p>Let me draw it how it should work:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Client and Server have persistent connection <strong>[can be done using ASP.NET 4.5 socket protocols]</strong></p></li> <li><p>Server knows to differentiate between a connection that comes from different pages, those with different query strings for example, id=1, id=2, etc. One option I thought about is to create an array in memory that stores the connection Ids for each connection string id value.

The <code>END</code> token eliminates the ambiguity by ensuring that an <code>IF</code> statement is always properly closed, like a pair of parentheses.</p>  <p>Parentheses make a good analogy here. Suppose you had a grammar like this:</p>  <pre><code>maybe_closed_parens : '(' stuff                     | '(' stuff ')'                     ; </code></pre>  <p><code>stuff</code> itself generates some grammar symbols, and one of them is <code>maybe_closed_parens</code>.</p>  <p>So if you have input like <code>((((((whatever</code>, it is correct. The parentheses do not have to be closed. But what if you add <code>)</code>? Which <code>(</code> is it closing?</p>  <p>This is very much like not being able to tell which <code>IF</code> matches an <code>ELSE</code>.</p>  <p>If you add <code>END</code> to the syntax of the <code>IF</code> (whether or not there is an <code>ELSE</code>), then that is like having a closing parentheses. <code>IF</code> and <code>END</code> are like <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>.</p>  <p>Of course, you are stylistically right not to want the word <code>END</code> in your language, because you already have curly braced blocks, which are basically an alternate spelling for Pascal's <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code>. Your <code>}</code> is already an <code>END</code> keyword.</p>  <p>So what you can do is impose the rule that an <code>IF</code> accepts only compound statements (i.e. fully braced):</p>  <pre><code>if_statement : IF condition compound_statement              | IF condition compound_statement ELSE compound_statement </code></pre>  <p>Now it is impossible to have an ambiguity like if x if y w else z because braces must be present: <code>if x { if y { w } else { z } } or if x { if y { w } } else { z }</code>.</p>  <p>I seem to recall that Perl is an example of a language which has made this choice. It's not a bad idea because not only does it eliminate your ambiguity, more importantly it eliminates ambiguities from programs.</p>  <p>I see that you don't have a <code>compound_statement</code> phrase structure rule in your grammar because your statement generates a phrase enclosed in <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> directly.

I have a feeling I've been understanding classes wrong and just want some clarification.</p>  <p>I've written a few of my own subclasses, and in each case I've defined them simply by following similar code in the gnome-shell javascript source:</p>  <pre><code>Subclass = function() {     this._init.apply(this,arguments); } Subclass.prototype = {     __proto__: Superclass.prototype,     _init: function() {         Superclass.prototype._init.call(this);     },     // add other methods of Subclass here. } </code></pre>  <p>Up to now I thought this was the standard way of making a class <code>Subclass</code> that was basically <code>Superclass</code> plus extras.

For one, not every class has a <code>_init</code> function as I assumed; this is just something that GNOME-shell has done in their javascript classes.</p>  <p>So, <strong>my questions are</strong>:</p>  <ol> <li>Is there any documentation regarding the above method of creating subclasses? All the tutorials I've seen say to set <code>Subclass.prototype = new Superclass()</code> instead of doing the <code>Subclass.prototype = { __proto__:Superclass.prototype, define_prototype_methods_here }</code> method, but my thought is that there must be some method to it if gnome-shell uses it consistently?</li> <li>If I wanted to stay as close as possible to the above way of defining classes (just so I can retain some code similarity to GNOME-shell for which I am writing extensions), <strong>what do I replace <code>Superclass.prototype._init.call(this)</code> with</strong> in <code>Subclass._init</code> to make sure that the <code>Subclass.prototype</code> gets all the methods/properties of <code>Superclass</code> (which I then add on to in my definition of <code>Subclass.prototype</code>), if the <code>Superclass</code> doesn't have an <code>_init</code> function (i.e. does it have some equivalent constructor function I call)?</li> </ol>  <p>I'm really confused about this all so please forgive me if my question doesn't make much sense; it'll be because of the extent of my misunderstanding &amp; confusion!</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: clarification:  - I know the <code>__proto__</code> is not recommended because it is non-standard, but my code is never going to run in a browser - it's only ever going to run with GNOME javascript (which is basically the Mozilla javascript engine), so I don't need to worry about cross-compatibility.</p> </td><td><javascript></td><td>2.0</td><td>javascript</td></tr><tr><td><p>I would suggest that you <code>remove</code> incomplete requests, but the module does not provide any interface to do so.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Option 1</strong>: Add removal functionality.</p>  <p>Add the following to your script:</p>  <pre><code>BEGIN {     require HTTP::Async;     package HTTP::Async;      if (!defined(&amp;remove)) {         *remove = sub {             my ($self, $id) = @_;              my $hashref = $self-&gt;{in_progress}{$id}                 or return undef;              my $s = $hashref-&gt;{handle};             $self-&gt;_io_select-&gt;remove($s);             delete $self-&gt;{fileno_to_id}{ $s-&gt;fileno };             delete $self-&gt;{in_progress}{$id};             delete $self-&gt;{id_opts}{$id};              return $hashref-&gt;{request};         };     }      if (!defined(&amp;remove_all)) {         *remove_all = sub {             my ($self) = @_;             return map $self-&gt;remove($_), keys %{ $self-&gt;{in_progress} };         };     } } </code></pre>  <p>You should contact the author and see if he can add this feature. <code>$id</code> is the value returned by <code>add</code>.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Option 2</strong>: Silence all warnings from the destructor.</p>  <p>If you're ok with not servicing all the requests, there's no harm in silencing the warnings.

Either way, the message objects themselves don't tell you the type, cause it's assumed you already knew that. Given that <code>req.flash()</code> is backed by <code>req.session.flash</code>, however, you can roll your own functionality.</p>  <p>First, you'll need to prepare your own list of messages that have the information you want, so that you can pass it to your view.  E.g.,</p>  <pre><code>var messagesByType = req.session.flash || {},     allMessages = []; Object.keys(messagesByType).forEach(function(type) {     var messages = messagesByType[type] || [];     messages.forEach(function(msg) {         allMessages.push({ type: type, text: msg });     }); }); req.session.flash = {}; </code></pre>  <p>Second, make sure you make <code>allMessages</code> available within your template.  E.g.,</p>  <pre><code>res.render('some-view', { messages: allMessages }); </code></pre>  <p>This should give you something you can iterate over within your view like this:</p>  <pre><code>for message in messages     p(class='alert-#{message.type}') #{message.text} </code></pre> </td><td>NULL</td><td>2.0</td><td>javascript</td></tr><tr><td><p>There's no such thing as a Map implementation that has a key stored without a value.

So these two constants represent the numbers you use when converting between angles in degrees and angles in radians.</p></li> <li><p>Looking at the code you've posted, you have the lines to convert <code>latRadians</code> to y.  It looks straightforward to implement code to invert those operations.  You need to 'un'-scale and 'un'-transform 'yScaled'.  For example, treating the line (part):</p>  <p><code>yScaled = ((height / 2.0) - (width * yTransformed / (2 * Math.PI)))</code></p>  <p>as a mathematical equation, you need to solve for <code>yTransformed</code> in terms of <code>yScaled</code>.</p></li> <li><p>As for the Gudermannian, the question you refer to implements that in one line of code and the inverse Gudermannian in 3 lines.  The Gudermannian is just a way of transforming a circular measurement (such as a measurement in degrees or radians) into a linear measurement (such as one in centimetres on a chart to be published on paper).  In particular, and pertinent here, the Gudermannian will transform a latitude into a linear distance from 0.</p></li> </ol>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>OK, so looking a bit closer, in your original code you transform the latitude from an angular measurement into a linear one with the line:</p>  <pre><code>yTransformed = Math.Log(Math.Tan((latRadians / 2) + (Math.PI / 4))) </code></pre>  <p>I think that you should probably replace this with a call to the inverse Gudermannian, as indicated in the answer to the question you link to.

We're actually involving two different   #  variables named 'x'.  One is local to func_B, the other is global.    # By calling func_A(), we do two things: we're reassigning the value   #  of the GLOBAL x as part of func_A, and then taking that same value   #  since it's returned by func_A, and assigning it to a LOCAL variable   #  named 'x'.        x = func_A() # look at this as: x_local = func_A()    # Here, we're assigning the value of 'B' to the LOCAL x.   x = 'B' # look at this as: x_local = 'B'    return x # look at this as: return x_local </code></pre>  <p>In fact, you could rewrite all of <code>func_B</code> with the variable named <code>x_local</code> and it would work identically.</p>  <p>The order matters only as far as the order in which your functions do operations that change the value of the global x.  Thus in our example, order doesn't matter, since <code>func_B</code> calls <code>func_A</code>.  In this example, order does matter:</p>  <pre><code>def a():   global foo   foo = 'A'  def b():   global foo   foo = 'B'  b() a() print foo # prints 'A' because a() was the last function to modify 'foo'. </code></pre>  <p>Note that <code>global</code> is only required to modify global objects.  You can still access them from within a function without declaring <code>global</code>. Thus, we have:</p>  <pre><code>x = 5  def access_only():   return x   # This returns whatever the global value of 'x' is  def modify():   global x   x = 'modified'   return x   # This function makes the global 'x' equal to 'modified', and then returns that value  def create_locally():   x = 'local!'   return x   # This function creates a new local variable named 'x', and sets it as 'local',   #  and returns that.  The global 'x' is untouched. </code></pre>  <p>Note the difference between <code>create_locally</code> and <code>access_only</code> -- <code>access_only</code> is accessing the global x despite not calling <code>global</code>, and even though <code>create_locally</code> doesn't use <code>global</code> either, it creates a local copy since it's <em>assigning</em> a value.</p>  <p>The confusion here is why you shouldn't use global variables.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>7.0</td><td>c++</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>In my script I have 2 functions.

Therefore I would like to be able to fire my routine ONLY if it's essentially about to throw a 404 error.</p>  <p>My routine to check the Db for old site Urls is cached, so at least it's not hitting the database every time, but I'd just like to prevent it from even calling this routine (and occasionally hitting the DB when the cache has expired) when it's not necessary.</p>  <p>I was thinking that perhaps I could perform the old url lookup from inside the Application_Error routine in global.asax, checking the error code for 404 status and in that scenario, do the old url lookup, but when testing, it doesn't appear to be hitting my breakpoint in that Application_Error routine in global.asax - instead the browser is showing the IIS 7 404 Not Found error.</p>  <p>It's imperative that the browser receives a 301 response to the new url and doesn't get an incorrect 404 response code (unless the requested url was neither a new or old flavour url).</p>  <p>Can anyone recommend an efficient approach to handling this situation?</p> </td><td><asp.net></td><td>4.0</td><td>php</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>I have a check box in my jsp page as</p>  <pre><code>&lt;input type=\"\"checkbox\"\" name=\"\"checkbox1\"\" value=\"\"1\"\" id=\"\"checkbox1\"\" onclick=\"\"changevalue(this)\"\"/&gt; </code></pre>  <p>Then in my script</p>  <pre><code>function changevalue(checkbox) {     if(checkbox.value==1)     {         checkbox.value=0;     }     else if(checkbox.value==0)     {         checkbox.value=1;     } } </code></pre>  <p>But when i submit the form the value of checkbox always is 1.Can any one tell me a solutioin for this.</p> \"</td><td><jsp><checkbox></td><td>3.0</td><td>jquery</td></tr><tr><td><p>First, define your model:</p>  <pre><code>class TimeModel(models.Model):     time = models.FloatField() </code></pre>  <p>To store a timedelta object:</p>  <pre><code># td is a timedelta object TimeModel.objects.create(time=td.total_seconds()) </code></pre>  <p>To get the timedelta object out of the database:</p>  <pre><code># Assume the previously created TimeModel object has an id of 1 td = timedelta(seconds=TimeModel.objects.get(id=1).time) </code></pre>  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm using Python 2.7 for this example.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>10.0</td><td>mysql</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>After clearly observing the output in the Template Builder, I got answer as </p>  <pre><code>&lt;xsl:element name=\"\"TCMID\"\"&gt;   &lt;xsl:value-of select=\"\"tcm:Component/@ID\"\"/&gt; &lt;/xsl:element&gt; &lt;xsl:element name=\"\"name\"\"&gt;   &lt;xsl:value-of select=\"\"tcm:Component/tcm:Data/tcm:Title\"\"/&gt; &lt;/xsl:element&gt; &lt;xsl:element name=\"\"Version\"\"&gt;   &lt;xsl:value-of select=\"\"tcm:Component/tcm:Info/tcm:VersionInfo/tcm:Version\"\"/&gt; &lt;/xsl:element&gt; </code></pre> \"</td><td>NULL</td><td>59.0</td><td>hibernate</td></tr><tr><td><p>I've run into similar issues before, and there isn't really a great pattern I've found for dealing with doing seemingly similar tasks in reverse.</p>  <p>While it makes sense to you as a human that they're similar, you really are just calling arbitrary methods as far as the compiler is concerned. The only obvious duplication is the order in which things are called:</p>  <ol> <li>find an item that we'd like to insert before or after</li> <li>check that the item exists</li> <li>insert the current item before or after it</li> </ol>  <p>You've solved the problem in one way already that basically does these checks. Your solution is however a little unreadable. Here's how I would solve that:</p>  <pre><code>$.fn.moveItem = function(dir){   var index = dir == 'up' ? 0:1,       item = this['getPreviousItem','getNextItem'][index]();   if(item.length){     this['insertBefore','insertAfter'][index].call(this,item);   } } </code></pre>  <p>By using an array index, we can see what is being called when it's being called a little easier than in your example. Also, the use of apply is unnecessary, as you know how many arguments you're passing, so call is better suited to that use case.</p>  <p>Not sure if that's any better, but it's a little shorter (is return false necessary?) and a bit more readable IMO.</p>  <p>In my opinion, centralizing actions is slightly more important than readability - if you want to optimize, change, or append to the action of moving something, you only have to do it in once place. You can always add comments to solve the readability issue.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>14.0</td><td>sql</td></tr><tr><td><pre><code>SELECT distinct g.serial_number FROM person_gps pg, client_gps cg, gps g WHERE cg.client_id = $INPUT AND pg.gps_id = cg.gps_id AND g.gps_id = cp.gps_id AND NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1                 FROM person_gps                WHERE gps_id = cg.gps_id                AND date2 IS NULL) ORDER BY gps_id </code></pre> </td><td>NULL</td><td>204.0</td><td>devexpress</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>It sounds like you have not assigned your delegate in your master view controller.</p>  <p>You should have something like this in your master view controller which sets up the delegate:</p>  <pre><code>    ThermoFluidsSelectorViewController *view = [[ThermoFluidsSelectorViewController alloc] init];     view.delegate = self; </code></pre>  <p>here you can see I create the view, then set the delegate of the view back to myself. </p>  <p>If you are not creating the Thermo... view controller programatically, but have used a storyboard, then you can set the delegate in the prepareForSegue: method of your master view controller:</p>  <pre><code>// Do some customisation of our new view when a table item has been selected - (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender {     // Make sure we're referring to the correct segue     if ([[segue identifier] isEqualToString:@\"\"MySegueID\"\"]) {      // Get reference to the destination view controller     ThermoFluidsSelectorViewController *cont = [segue destinationViewController];      // set the delegate     cont.delegate = self; </code></pre>  <p>Hope this helps.</p> \"</td><td>NULL</td><td>723.0</td><td>mobile-safari</td></tr><tr><td><p>The Spring Framework solves this problem by using dependency injection.

Since it has been taught that anything which could be expressed recursively could be expressed iteratively, and iteration is preferred in Python, how would this be accomplished without recursion or imported modules in Python 2.6 (as a learning exercise)? (A nested list itself would be counted as an element, as would its contents.) For example:</p>  <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def element_count(p): ...     count = 0 ...     for entry in p: ...         count += 1 ...         if isinstance(entry, list):             ...             count += element_count(entry) ...     return count &gt;&gt;&gt; print element_count([1, [], 3])  3  &gt;&gt;&gt; print element_count([1, [1, 2, [3, 4]]]) 7 &gt;&gt;&gt; print element_count([[[[[[[[1, 2, 3]]]]]]]]) 10 </code></pre>  <p>How would this be written using iteration?</p> </td><td><python><recursion><iteration></td><td>10.0</td><td>mysql</td></tr><tr><td><p>You can rebuild your query this way:</p>  <pre><code>@users = User.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; ['user = ?', session[:login]])  </code></pre>  <p>But this one looks better:</p>  <pre><code>@users = User.where(user: session[:login]) </code></pre> </td><td>NULL</td><td>59.0</td><td>hibernate</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>I have a button</p>  <pre><code>   &lt;button onclick=\"\"DeletaItem('template'</td><td>1</td><td>59.0</td><td>hibernate</td></tr><tr><td><p>The line</p>  <pre><code>int *primesArr; </code></pre>  <p>Declares <code>primesArr</code> as a pointer variable but doesn't allocate any memory for it.

First, there's no need to test every even number; if <code>k &gt; 2</code> and <code>(k % 2) == 0</code>, then <code>k</code> cannot be prime.  So you can eliminate half of the tests by checking explicitly for 2 (prime) or divisibility by 2 (not prime), and then using</p>  <pre><code>for (int i = 3;  i &lt; k;  i += 2) {  // 'i' is the number 'k' is divided by </code></pre>  <p>But you can make this <em>still</em> more efficient, because you can stop after reaching <code>sqrt(k)</code>.  Why?  If <code>k</code> is divisible by some number <code>i</code>, then it must also be divisible by <code>k/i</code> (because <code>i * k/i</code>=<code>k</code>).  And if <code>i &gt; sqrt(k)</code>, then <code>k/i &lt; sqrt(k)</code> and the loop would already have exited.

The compiler will behave as if the lines are concatenated by matching the location of the trailing &amp; with the leading &amp; on the next line.  Since Fortran is happy to ignore spaces between tokens what you have posted is a way of writing a very long statement across a number of source file lines. (OP probably already knows all this, other readers may not.)</p>  <p>The snippet you show is definitely standard-conforming Fortran 90.  The standard defines a trailing &amp; to be the continuation character.  If you want to split either a token (such as a variable name) or a 'character-context' (such as a string literal) across lines then the line onto which the continuation runs must start with an &amp; and there must be no blanks inserted into the sequence of characters after the line-starting &amp;.  I think that what you have posted sneaks into standard-conformity on the grounds that the successive &amp;s might be considered to be not introducing any whitespace into the existing whitespace.</p>  <p>However, the line-starting &amp;s are not required in your snippet.</p>  <p>Your snippet is definitely not standard-conforming fixed-format FORTRAN77.  However, most modern Fortran compilers will, unless you instruct them otherwise, take a relaxed view of this sort of 'not-standard-conforming' but 'obvious-what-is-meant' code and compile it quite happily.  Unless, that is, you try something odd like adding free-format code into an existing fixed-format source file, that's just asking for the compiler to have a hissy fit.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>My original answer failed to answer OP's question relating to moving the &amp;s into the 73rd column as a tactic for creating code to keep fixed- and free-form compilation happy.  In FORTRAN77 continuation is marked by a character (any character) in column 6 of the continuing line.  That version of the language did not require any character at the end of the line being continued.  Again, I can't see anything wrong with putting an &amp; in column 73.  As OP pointed out in a comment, fixed-form Fortran ignores any characters in col 73-80, and punched cards (ahh, happy days) had only 80 columns.</p>  <p>But I can't see anything to recommend this approach either.  I think that it is far preferable not to mix free- and fixed-form in the same source file.  All the current Fortran compilers will compile both forms in the same compilation.  But if you want to go ahead and mix the two, feel free to do so.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>7.0</td><td>c++</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>If you have multiple internal subnets, the industry standard is to create sub-interfaces and encapsulate as a DOT1Q trunk between the router and the switch. </p>  <p>Example R1</p>  <p>Interfaces:</p>  <p>S0/0/0 - used for WAN Fa0/1 -physical internal interface Fa0/1.100 Data VLAN (sub-interface) Fa0/1.200 Voice VLAN (sub-interface)</p>  <p>Switch.

First i was wonder how to change the page liferay redirects when a user tries to access a page that has Power User view permissions. Liferay by default points to localhost:web/guest/home where they have their login page. On my application i have a different login in page and i want to redirect to the following page. I was browsing the web and found out that by setting <code>auth.login.site.url=/whereiwontittopoint</code> should actualy redirect me there. However it does not. I'm using Liferay  6.0.6 Community Editions. Has anyone done this? Is this the right way or this need to be done with a hook? </p>  <p>My other question is the following. I want to have a custom role on some pages. And i want when a user does not have that specfic role to be redirect to a totaly different page not the default login. I'm fairly sure this can be done by using the hook on some service but for some reason i can not identify this service. </p>  <p>EDIT Ok for the first question i solved the issues. For the second question the answers i got here were not what i was looking for probably because i didn't post the question correctly. This is a full scenario of what i have done and what i need to do:</p>  <p>First of all i changed the /web/guest path that's on every liferay page to web/somthing/ this might not play a crucial role but the problems(some of the problems) started when that happend. THe over all idea is the following. I'm using spring mvc to create the application. I have created a backend to my application from where the admin can create pages for other users to see(This is not done by going to the control panel of liferay and adding a page but through the logic of the application). Once a page is created depending on some logic i create a role for that certain page(customer role also through code not the liferay admin). Some of the users are given this role if the satisfy some criteria and some are not. Here my problem arises, once a user that is loged in to my application tries to access a page (by inputting a direct URL in the browser to the page) that requres the view permision of the role i create for that page and the user does not have the appropriate role he gets redirect to lets say localhost/web/(username)/home a personal page and for some reason on that page by default from liferay he is able to view personal data(user name) of all other users of the application. My question is how through code to handle the redirection that happens of the above scenario.  I have tried on one attempt to actualy hook the servlet.service.events.pre action and before the user access that page to check if he has the appropriate permisions and actualy change his request. So far i have some issues but i can resolve them but this approach is not what i not rly what i am looking for because this action is executed before every single request on the application( and the page handling is just small part of that application) which means i will have a lot of code executing for no reason.

But in the long run the 'source as text' won. Still you can emulate some of that in many current Lisp environments. For example many Lisp systems allow to write an 'image' of the current execution memory - this image includes all data and all code (also the compiled code).

I'm using a (extended) FileReferenceList and (my own) FileReferenceDisplayList. The latter listens for events from the former.<br> If the FileReferenceDisplayList receives a FileReferenceListEvent.ADDED event, it should display the new item in the displaylist. However, when multiple files are added at once I want to animate them sequentially in stead of at the same time. What would be the best strategy for making sure the items are animated with small pauses between them?</p>  <p>I thought about putting newly added items in a queue and then polling the queue for existing items with an Event.ENTER_FRAME. But maybe you can suggest another method that doesn't need to make use of Event.ENTER_FRAME?</p>  <p><strong>Edit</strong><br> I guess I forgot to mention that the part that puzzles me the most how I can set some timeout if multiple files are added. Maybe I should use the queue's length to multiply the timeouts for the items? So, if a file is added, I set the animation timeout for that item to be multiplied by the current length of the queue?

They originally come with the .frm extension and c# forms are .cs.  I tried 'add existing item' to the project but obviously that didn't work, and I tried a couple of other things.

(Like a 15 MB string) The only problem is it's very slow. Here is what I'm doing:</p>  <pre><code>char * buff = ... wxString data(buff, wxConvUTF8); text-&gt;ChangeValue(data); </code></pre>  <p>However, this is not the bottleneck. That occurrs as soon as the function this block of code is in returns. The whole app freezes for about 30 seconds. I tried wxYield right after ChangeValue and that causes the first few lines of the string to be displayed in the control but it still freezes after.

But it does nothing else; pretty much because the shaders look like this:</p>  <h3>Vertex Shader</h3>  <pre><code>uniform mat4 uMVPMatrix; attribute vec4 aPosition;  void main() {     gl_Position = uMVPMatrix * aPosition; } </code></pre>  <h3>Fragment Shader</h3>  <pre><code>void main() {     gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0); } </code></pre>  <p>Now they are pretty basic. The reason that I have not gone further is because I cannot figure out if I am supposed to write one shader to apply to all of my different objects or if I am supposed to use multiple shaders. And if I am supposed to use multiple shaders to draw multiple different objects then how do I go about doing that in an efficient way?</p>  <p>I get the feeling that this must be basic knowledge to anybody that does OpenGL ES 2.0 day in and day out so I am hoping that somebody can answer my question or point me in the right direction.</p>  <p>I have:</p>  <ul> <li>Looked at multiple tutorials; none of which use anything but the most basic shaders.</li> <li>Read the entire OpenGL ES 2.0 GLSL Spec (none of which mentioned how it was intended to be used; it was just about what everything did rather than how it fits together).</li> <li>Tried to modify my shaders a bit.</li> </ul>  <p>So I'm hoping that I am close to understanding the OpenGL workflow but I don't seem to be there yet. </p>  <p>Edit: I found this well afterwards:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If your application is written for OpenGL ES 2.0, do not create a single shader with lots of switches and conditionals that performs every task your application needs to render the scene. Instead, compile multiple shader programs that each perform a specific, focused task.</p> </blockquote>  <p>That is from the <a href=\"\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/Performance/Performance.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008793-CH105-SW11\"\" rel=\"\"noreferrer\"\">iOS OpenGL ES 2.0 guidelines.</a></p> \"</td><td><android><opengl-es-2.0><shader></td><td>5.0</td><td>android</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>2 months ago my AIR Android app support more than 1100 devices and 706 now.

If the device is held in Portrait mode after stand by,it freezes the navigation  bar buttons. As far as I have concluded,this is because the application gets active in portrait mode by default and since the device is also held in Portrait mode,it can not find any orientation to rotate and hence freezes the buttons.Except navigation bar buttons,everything works fine.And if I rotate the device,like I have said,Everything works fine.</p>  <p>Dont have any idea,why this is happening.Can someone explain?</p> </td><td><ios><ipad></td><td>12.0</td><td>asp.net</td></tr><tr><td><p>elisp is a good language, I find it can handle all kind of jobs, but can I use it like a shell script?</p>  <p>i.e. execute some *.el files from the console, without launching Emacs.

By now, I hope it's clear that Clang is absolutely the way to go when programming, with Clang being the default compiler in the newer versions of Xcode and supporting ARC and new and upcoming language constructs (array and dictionary subscripting, literals, etc.). There's almost absolutely no reason to compile with GCC anymore, and for codebases using ARC and new features, using  plain GCC is no longer relevant or possible (LLVM-GCC may support these features, but it provides no advantage over Clang now that Clang is completely stable).</p>  <hr>  <p>By now (with LLVM-2.0 included in the Xcode 4.0 beta), LLVM is mature enough for production code use. It compiles a little quicker than GCC, and produces faster code, so use it whenever you can (pretty much, try to avoid GCC if something better is available). The standard Xcode 3.2.5 install contains LLVM-1.6 (not the latest), so I'd recommend either running some speed tests to see if there's a noticeable difference between GCC and LLVM, or compiling Clang from source and getting the latest version.</p>  <p>Essentially, there's no need for GCC any more, LLVM + Clang is more than enough.</p> </td><td>NULL</td><td>19.0</td><td>css</td></tr><tr><td><p>If we are in the same network, then hop to hop communication takes place by layer-2 devices such as switches, bridges, <em>etc.</em> that work at the MAC layer.</p>  <p>But if we have to send packets to a destination in some other network then hop to hop communication takes place through routers.</p>  <p>Is this correct?</p> </td><td><networking><communication><router></td><td>0.0</td><td>c#</td></tr><tr><td>\"<p>I also had a similar problem, which I managed to fix, but I was not using an <code>ObservableCollection</code>, but a normal <code>List&lt;Column&gt;</code>, <code>Column</code> being a class of mine, that contained as public members: string, int and bool, which are all xmlserializable.

This is allways application/xml.</p>  <p>How can I change the Accept-Types so that I only get json responses?

I don't want to discard them, as I don't want to load them again, but with my current strategy, I would be loading them a second time and creating markers for them a second time.</p>  <p>While I think it's not a good idea to somehow tell the backend in the AJAX call that I already have some of the markers, it'd be nice to <strong>implement some sort of a hashtable that doesn't allow duplicates</strong>.</p>  <p>That way, when I load the points, I can try adding them to the hashtable first: if that succeeds, I haven't displayed them yet, so I can add them as markers; if it fails, they're already on the map.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Is this a good strategy?</strong> If so, how can I implement a hashtable that doesn't allow duplicates?</p> </td><td><javascript><google-maps><google-maps-api-3><lazy-loading></td><td>815.0</td><td>post</td></tr><tr><td><p>I want to somehow round the numbers for a rating system in PHP like this:</p>  <pre><code>4.6667 = 4.6  5.0001 = 5.0 </code></pre>  <p>Is there any way to do that?

First i want to say that i'm very new to the drupalling world, so this question can be quiet stupid. I'm trying to develop/make a part of a site that has the following structure:</p>  <ul> <li>(level one) virtual_exhibitions: shows an overview of exhibition categories.</li> <li>(level two) themes, places, people: which is an exhibition category.</li> <li>(level three) love, belgium, napoleon: which are exhibitions, every one of there will give a list of photos related to the exhibition subject.</li> </ul>  <p>now i created a new node-type: virtual-exhibition. and i created a vocabulary: exhibition-categories.</p>  <p>now to create the structure i used views:</p>  <ul> <li>one view to list all the nodes from a selected category with a link to the node.</li> <li>one view to list all the categories.</li> </ul>  <p>now i was wondering if this is the drupal way to do this, or are there better alternatives. This is working, but i'm not sure if this is the right way.</p>  <p>Another question related to this, i want to use clean urls:</p>  <ul> <li>virtual_exhibitions</li> <li>virtual_exhibitions/themes, virtual_exhibitions/places, ...</li> <li>virtual_exhibitions/themes/love, virtual_exhibitions/places/belgium, ...</li> </ul>  <p>The first one is easy, i can configure this in the views UI. The second one is a bit harder because the categories can have special characters like a ' or a , etc. So i need a raw version (as can be used in path auto) in fact it would be best that my default link of the vocabulary term redirects to this view. because the url of the vocabulary term is very easy to configure using path auto and then i can just use the vocabulary term url in stead of always building it manually.</p>  <p>The reason why i'm using a view for the second level is because it needs a custom layout and as far as i know it isn't possible to style a vocabulary-term of a specific vocabulary. When you style it this style will be used for all the vocabulary-terms.</p>  <p>i hope my description is a bit clear and that somebody can give me some remarks on how i best do this.</p> </td><td><php><drupal-6><drupal-views></td><td>3.0</td><td>jquery</td></tr><tr><td><p>I need to get the contact image for a particular person from my address book in iPhone.

For example, I have</p>  <pre><code>typedef std::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, persistent_alloc&lt;char&gt;&gt; pstring;  pstring a, b, c; std::string x, y, z; </code></pre>  <p>I want to be able to do things like:</p>  <pre><code>if (a == x)     a = y; c = z + b; </code></pre>  <p>and so forth, but by default it does not work, as <code>pstring</code> and <code>std::string</code> are unrelated types.  Now as far as the comparison is concerned, I can define:</p>  <pre><code>template&lt;typename Alloc1, typename Alloc2&gt; inline bool operator==(const std::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, Alloc1&gt; &amp;a,            const std::basic_string&lt;char, std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;, Alloc2&gt; &amp;b) {     return strcmp(a.c_str(), b.c_str()) == 0; } </code></pre>  <p>...and now I can compare strings for equality.

So it seems this solution is not as simple as id hoped. </p>  <pre><code>$('div#cover').click(function(){   $('#select').focus(); }); </code></pre> ",

Sadly, vague questions get vague answers, and the bottom line is that no one person on SO is going to write this code for you. You have a lot of research to do yourself. Here's a basic description of how I would get started.</p>  <p>First look into tying the app in with the camera. This is pretty easy, there's an intent you can call and onActivityResult you can receive the path to the file of the image they took.</p>  <p>The layout of your edit activity to edit the picture will have to have a Canvas object, and you'll probably need some buttons underneath or above it for them to pick their drawing tool.</p>  <p>The Canvas of the layout has to be implemented in a separate class, and it needs to implement runnable. This requires you making a <code>run()</code> function in the Canvas class, and inside of that you'll have a loop. Through each iteration of that loop, you'll clear the canvas, draw the picture using <code>drawBitmap()</code> to fill the screen, and then draw everything that the user has drawn.</p>  <p>Now, in the edit activity you'll have to implement a touch listener. This will require you making a <code>onTouch()</code> method that will give you a <code>MotionEvent</code> telling you where and how the touch occurred. Each time the screen is touched you'll want to look at the tools they currently have selected, and add it to the drawing that is painted on the Canvas.</p>  <p>When they're done, save the result of the Canvas. I am not saying that this is the best way to create the app that you have in mind, and I am by no means an expert. This is just a suggestion of where I would start thinking as a beginner.</p>  <p>Like I said, you have a lot to learn! I recommend searching for any terms you don't understand or widgets you haven't heard of that I mentioned, and looking at tutorials related to them. Somebody mentioned newboston and they're right, he has good tutorials.

There's also a limit of 256 MB so as near as I can tell this is both the most time and memory efficient solution to the problem...</p>  <p>edit: The possible values for N and K are N &lt;= 10^9 and K &lt;= N, which is why I chose to do everything using BigInteger.  The maximum number of trials is 10000. So basically, you input the number of trials, then a pair of integer values for each number of trials, and the program computes the three versions of the binomial coefficient for the equation in the second loop. I figured it would be faster to read everything into the arrays, then process the arrays and put the results into a third array to be processed by the third loop because I figured it might be faster that way. I tried doing everything in the same loop and it ran slower.  </p>  <p>I've tried three or four different algorithms for calculating the binomial coefficient (nCr - or n choose r, all are different ways of saying the same thing). Some of the algorithms involve a two dimensional array like c[n][k]. This is the only solution I've submitted that didn't come back with some sort of memory error. The answer needs to be output mod (10 ^ 6) + 3 because the answers of nCr * nCr get pretty huge.  A sample run of the program is:</p>  <pre><code>3  4 1 5 2 90 13  2 5 815483 </code></pre>  <p>Can't run it on a faster machine because it needs to pass on their machine to count, basically I submit the code and they run it against their test cases, and I have no idea what their test case is, just that the inputs are within the bounds given above.</p>  <p>And the program itself:</p>  <pre><code>import java.math.BigInteger; import java.util.Scanner;  public class Solution {  public BigInteger nCr(int n, int r) {     if (r &gt; n ) {         return BigInteger.ZERO;     }      if (r &gt; n / 2) {         r = n - r;     }     BigInteger result = BigInteger.ONE;      for (int i = 0; i &lt; r; i++) {         result = result.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(n - i));         result = result.divide(BigInteger.valueOf(i + 1));     }     return result; }  public static void main(String[] args) {     Scanner input = new Scanner( System.in );     BigInteger m = BigInteger.valueOf(1000003);     Solution p = new Solution();     short T = input.nextShort(); // Number of trials     BigInteger intermediate = BigInteger.ONE;     int[] r = new int[T];     int[] N = new int[T];     int[] K = new int[T];      short x = 0;      while (x &lt; T) {     N[x] = input.nextInt();     K[x] = input.nextInt();     x++;     }      x = 0;     while (x &lt; T) {     if (N[x] &gt;= 3) {              r[x] = ((p.nCr(N[x] - 3, K[x]).multiply(p.nCr(N[x] + K[x], N[x] - 1))).divide(BigInteger.valueOf((N[x] + K[x]))).mod(m)).intValue();         } else {             r[x] = 0;     }     x++;     }      x = 0;     while (x &lt; T) {     System.out.println(r[x]);     x++;     } } </code></pre>  <p>}</p> ",

Among these are:</p>  <ul> <li>Program Files and Program Files (x86)</li> <li>Windows</li> <li>ProgramData</li> </ul>  <p>It think it is good programming practice to never assume that file operations will work without error. You can anticipate on errors and warn the user beforehand and you <em>must</em> embed any file operation in an <code>On Error Goto</code> block.</p>  <p>About the program crashing when it is run elevated (this is really the solution of last resort, try to avoid this): The problem with the VirtualStore is that you can end up with two versions of a file: the one written when elevated and the one written when not elevated.

The table includes the name of the document and the folder the document is stored in.</p>  <p>I'm looking for the best way of serving these document back up to the client.

We sequentially allocate space to the stacks and we link new blocks to the previous block. This means any new element in a stack keeps a pointer to the previous top element of that particular stack. In this implementation, we face a problem of unused space. For example, if a stack deletes some of its elements, the deleted elements may not necessarily appear at the end of the array. So, in that case, we would not be able to use those newly freed spaces. To overcome this deficiency, we can maintain a free list and the whole array space would be given initially to the free list. For every insertion, we would delete an entry from the free list. In case of deletion, we would simply add the index of the free cell to the free list. In this implementation we would be able to have flexibility in terms of variable space utilization but we would need to increase the space complexity.</p>  <pre><code>1 int stackSize = 300; 2 int indexUsed = 0; 3 int[] stackPointer = {-1,-1,-1}; 4 StackNode[] buffer = new StackNode[stackSize * 3];  5 void push(int stackNum, int value) { 6     int lastIndex = stackPointer[stackNum]; 7     stackPointer[stackNum] = indexUsed; 8     indexUsed++; 9     buffer[stackPointer[stackNum]]=new StackNode(lastIndex,value); 10 }  11 int pop(int stackNum) { 12    int value = buffer[stackPointer[stackNum]].value; 13    int lastIndex = stackPointer[stackNum]; 14    stackPointer[stackNum] = buffer[stackPointer[stackNum]].previous; 15    buffer[lastIndex] = null; 16    indexUsed--; 17    return value; 18 }  19 int peek(int stack) { return buffer[stackPointer[stack]].value; }  20 boolean isEmpty(int stackNum) { return stackPointer[stackNum] == -1; } 21 22 class StackNode { 23    public int previous; 24    public int value; 25    public StackNode(int p, int v){ 26       value = v; 27       previous = p; 28    } 29 } </code></pre>  <p>my question is: in the mothod pop(), after setting buffer[lastIndex] to null(line 15), then indexUsed--(line 16), will the indexUsed be the head of the empty space?  let's call the <strong>Stack Top nodes of</strong> first stack : S1, second stack : S2, third stack : S3; what happens if:  I have s1 followed by s2 and s3 pushed before I wanted to pop s1,</p>  <pre><code>index:    10   11   12    13 ------------------------------- | ...   | s1 | s2 | s3 | null | ------------------------------- </code></pre>  <p>the <strong>indexUsed</strong> is now 13.

In C++, an integer is allowed as the if condition.  One big reason for this is to maintain compatibility with C - in C, there is no boolean type, so integers are perfectly valid if conditions.</p>  <p>You may ask: Why does Java disallow integers as if conditions?  One very important reason to do this is to stop a common bug.  It's common to write</p>  <pre><code>if (x = 10) </code></pre>  <p>while actually meaning</p>  <pre><code>if (x == 10) </code></pre>  <p>In fact, this is so common that many C/C++ programmers write</p>  <pre><code>if (10 == x) </code></pre>  <p>instead, just so it's harder to write an accidental assignment.</p>  <p>If you really do mean to perform an assignment, you can always write</p>  <pre><code>x = 10; // ... </code></pre>  <p>because <code>x = 10</code> is always nonzero and thus the C++ version will always enter the if.

An uninitialized variable is <strong>NOT</strong> null in C, C++, or Java!  Java doesn't allow you to use an uninitialized local (and fields are automatically initialized), so you can never use an uninitialized variable in Java.  In C/C++, an uninitialized variable <em>may</em> be null, but there is no guarantee whatsoever of that.

But its not like I have to deal with this on a daily basis, so I dont see that its that important, especially considering how easy to read the scripts are.</p>  <p>Here's the build script in SCons that does the same as mentioned previously for CMake:</p>  <pre><code>env = Environment() env.EnsurePythonVersion(2, 5) env.EnsureSConsVersion(2, 1)  libTarget = env.SharedLibrary(target = 'foo', source = ['a.cpp', 'b.cpp', 'c.pp']) env.Program(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.cpp', libTarget]) </code></pre>  <p>The SCons Glob() function is a nice option, but I tend to shy away from <em>automatically</em> building all the files in a directory. The same goes for listing sub-directories to be built. Ive been burned enough times by this, and prefer explicitly specifying the file/dirs to be built.</p>  <p>In case you hear those rumors that SCons is slower than other alternatives, the <a href=\"\"http://www.scons.org/wiki/GoFastButton\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">SCons GoFastButton</a> has some pointers that can help out.</p> \"",

For each checked exception which is a possible result,   the throws clause for the method (§8.4.6) or constructor (§8.8.5) must   mention the class of that exception or one of the superclasses of the   class of that exception. This compile-time checking for the presence   of exception handlers is designed to reduce the number of exceptions   which are not properly handled.</p>      <p>The unchecked exceptions classes are the class RuntimeException and   its subclasses, and the class Error and its subclasses. All other   exception classes are checked exception classes. The Java API defines   a number of exception classes, both checked and unchecked. Additional   exception classes, both checked and unchecked, may be declared by   programmers. See §11.5 for a description of the exception class   hierarchy and some of the exception classes defined by the Java API   and Java virtual machine.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So basically it looks at the code, if it comes across an exception, looks up the inheritance hierarchy of the exception to decide  if it is checked or unchecked.</p>  <p><a href=\"\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/exceptions.html\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Read</a></p> \"",

         "<p>I have an issue in my use of critical sections.  My app has a large number of threads, say 60, which all need access to a global resource.  I therefore protect that resource with a critical section.  This works perfectly during operation, however when my application shuts down, I trigger the threads to quit, and then destroy the critical section.</p>  <p>The problem comes if some of those threads are waiting on the critical section at exit time, and thus are blocked from quitting themselves.</p>  <p>I've written a wrapper around the windows CriticalSection calls that has an 'Initialised' flag, which I set to true when the crit is created, and set to false when I'm about to leave the crit (both cases are set when inside the crit).  This flag is checked before the 'enter crit' wrapper function tries entering the crit, bypassing the request if the flag is false.  The flag is also checked the moment any thread successfully enters the crit, making it immediately leave the crit if it's false.</p>  <p>What I to do prior to deleting the crit is set the flag to false, then wait for any waiting threads to: be allowed into the crit; see the Initialised flag is false; then leave the crit (which should be a pretty quick operating for each thread).</p>  <p>I check the number of threads waiting for access to the crit by checking the LockCount inside the CRITICAL_SECTION struct, and waiting until it hits 0 (in XP, that's <code>LockCount - (RecursionCount-1)</code>; in 2003 server and above, the lock count is <code>((-1) - (LockCount)) &gt;&gt; 2</code>), before I then destroy the critical section.</p>  <p>This <em>should</em> be sufficient, however I'm finding that the LockCount reaches 0 when there's still one thread (always just one thread, never more) waiting to enter the crit, meaning if I delete the crit at that point, the other thread subsequently wakes up from waiting on the crit, and causes a crash as the CRITICAL_SECTION object has by that time been destroyed.</p>  <p>If I keep my own internal lock count of threads waiting for access, I have the correct count; however this isn't ideal as I have to increment this count outside of the crit, meaning that value isn't protected and therefore can't be entirely relied upon at any one time.</p>  <p>Does anyone know why the LockCount in the CRITICAL_SECTION struct would be out by 1?  If I use my own lock count, then check the CRITICAL_SECTION's lock count <em>after</em> that last thread has exited (and before I destroy the crit), it's still 0...</p>  <p>Or, is there a better way for me to protect the global resource in my app with that many threads, other than a critical section?</p>  <p>This is my wrapper struct:</p>  <pre><code>typedef struct MY_CRIT {     BOOL Initialised;     CRITICAL_SECTION Crit;     int MyLockCount; } </code></pre>  <p>Here's my Crit init function:</p>  <pre><code>BOOL InitCrit( MY_CRIT *pCrit ) {     if (pCrit)     {         InitializeCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );                   pCrit-&gt;Initialised = TRUE;         pCrit-&gt;MyLockCount = 0;         return TRUE;     }     // else invalid pointer     else             return FALSE; } </code></pre>  <p>This is my enter crit wrapper function:</p>  <pre><code>BOOL EnterCrit( MY_CRIT *pCrit ) {     // if pointer valid, and the crit is initialised     if (pCrit &amp;&amp; pCrit-&gt;Initialised)     {         pCrit-&gt;MyLockCount++;         EnterCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );         pCrit-&gt;MyLockCount--;          // if still initialised         if (pCrit-&gt;Initialised)         {             return TRUE;         }         // else someone's trying to close this crit - jump out now!         else         {             LeaveCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );             return FALSE;         }     }     else // crit pointer is null         return FALSE; } </code></pre>  <p>And here's my FreeCrit wrapper function:</p>  <pre><code>void FreeCrit( MY_CRIT *pCrit ) {     LONG    WaitingCount = 0;      if (pCrit &amp;&amp; (pCrit-&gt;Initialised))     {         // set Initialised to FALSE to stop any more threads trying to get in from now on:         EnterCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );         pCrit-&gt;Initialised = FALSE;         LeaveCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );          // loop until all waiting threads have gained access and finished:         do {             EnterCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );              // check if any threads are still waiting to enter:             // Windows XP and below:             if (IsWindowsXPOrBelow())             {                 if ((pCrit-&gt;Crit.LockCount &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; ((pCrit-&gt;Crit.RecursionCount - 1) &gt;= 0))                     WaitingCount = pCrit-&gt;Crit.LockCount - (pCrit-&gt;Crit.RecursionCount - 1);                 else                     WaitingCount = 0;             }             // Windows 2003 Server and above:             else             {                 WaitingCount = ((-1) - (pCrit-&gt;Crit.LockCount)) &gt;&gt; 2;             }                          // hack: if our own lock count is higher, use that:             WaitingCount = max( WaitingCount, pCrit-&gt;MyLockCount );              // if some threads are still waiting, leave the crit and sleep a bit, to give them a chance to enter &amp; exit:             if (WaitingCount &gt; 0)             {                 LeaveCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );                 // don't hog the processor:                 Sleep( 1 );             }             // when no other threads are waiting to enter, we can safely delete the crit (and leave the loop):             else             {                 DeleteCriticalSection( &amp;pCrit-&gt;Crit );             }         } while (WaitingCount &gt; 0);     } } </code></pre> ",

Storage is constant once generated and only accessed for reading.</p>  <p>EDIT: I guess what i need is a substitute for a resource dll that can work (or easily made to work) without a runtime linker and a file system.</p> ",

If the point has a lower x-cooordinate, it's to the left, and if it has a greater x-coordinate, it's to the right. </p>  <p>There are two ways to improve on this explanation in a real implementation, one of which I mentioned about:</p>  <ol> <li>Use a balanced search tree to find the right segment instead of iterating through a sorted list, to bring the time from <code>O(n)</code> to <code>O(log n)</code></li> <li>Reconceptualize the search as finding the intersection of the polyline and the horizontal line y = y0 through the search point. Then just compare the x value of the intersection against the search point.</li> </ol> ",

Then I can query the memory and if, for example, [5, 05/11/2012 12:03:45] I can know if they data was last updated by saving the last time I queries the memory in the client side, and compare the dates. If the client datetime value is older than the one in the key/value in the memory, then I would query the database again.</p>  <p>However, it's still a passive approach.</p>  <p>Let me draw it how it should work:</p>  <ol> <li><p>Client and Server have persistent connection <strong>[can be done using ASP.NET 4.5 socket protocols]</strong></p></li> <li><p>Server knows to differentiate between a connection that comes from different pages, those with different query strings for example, id=1, id=2, etc. One option I thought about is to create an array in memory that stores the connection Ids for each connection string id value. For example: {1: 2346,6767,87878, 2:876,8765,3455}. 1 and 2 are the page's identification (ie. id=1, id=2), and the other values are the connection ids of the persistent connection that I get using ASP.net 4.5</p></li> <li><p>A column value in a row with primary key value id=5 has its column 'count' updated from value '1' to '2'.</p></li> <li><p>A trigger calls a function and pass the id (let's  assume value X) of the changed row. I prefer being able to also send specific columns' value ( some column  of my choice) <strong>[this is done using CLR triggers]</strong></p></li> <li><p>The function has a list of connections, for the clients who are visiting the page with id with value X (a number)</p></li> <li><p>The Server sends the client the column values, or if it's not possible, just send true or false, notifying the client that a change to that row has been taken place.</p></li> </ol>  <p><strong>Solved until now:</strong></p>  <p>1] Can be done using ASP.NET 4.5 socket protocols</p>  <p>4] Using CLR triggers I can have a function that gets to have the columns data and id of a specific row that was altered.</p>  <p>I am developing my app using ASP.NET 4.5.</p>  <p>Thanks</p> ",

Your <code>}</code> is already an <code>END</code> keyword.</p>  <p>So what you can do is impose the rule that an <code>IF</code> accepts only compound statements (i.e. fully braced):</p>  <pre><code>if_statement : IF condition compound_statement              | IF condition compound_statement ELSE compound_statement </code></pre>  <p>Now it is impossible to have an ambiguity like if x if y w else z because braces must be present: <code>if x { if y { w } else { z } } or if x { if y { w } } else { z }</code>.</p>  <p>I seem to recall that Perl is an example of a language which has made this choice. It's not a bad idea because not only does it eliminate your ambiguity, more importantly it eliminates ambiguities from programs.</p>  <p>I see that you don't have a <code>compound_statement</code> phrase structure rule in your grammar because your statement generates a phrase enclosed in <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> directly.

I have a feeling I've been understanding classes wrong and just want some clarification.</p>  <p>I've written a few of my own subclasses, and in each case I've defined them simply by following similar code in the gnome-shell javascript source:</p>  <pre><code>Subclass = function() {     this._init.apply(this,arguments); } Subclass.prototype = {     __proto__: Superclass.prototype,     _init: function() {         Superclass.prototype._init.call(this);     },     // add other methods of Subclass here. } </code></pre>  <p>Up to now I thought this was the standard way of making a class <code>Subclass</code> that was basically <code>Superclass</code> plus extras. I assumed that every object had a <code>_init</code> method.</p>  <p>I've recently tried to apply the same method to make a subclass of a <code>Clutter.Actor</code> (what's important is that it's not a GNOME-shell-defined class), and realised that the above way of subclassing objects is not the standard. For one, not every class has a <code>_init</code> function as I assumed; this is just something that GNOME-shell has done in their javascript classes.</p>  <p>So, <strong>my questions are</strong>:</p>  <ol> <li>Is there any documentation regarding the above method of creating subclasses? All the tutorials I've seen say to set <code>Subclass.prototype = new Superclass()</code> instead of doing the <code>Subclass.prototype = { __proto__:Superclass.prototype, define_prototype_methods_here }</code> method, but my thought is that there must be some method to it if gnome-shell uses it consistently?</li> <li>If I wanted to stay as close as possible to the above way of defining classes (just so I can retain some code similarity to GNOME-shell for which I am writing extensions), <strong>what do I replace <code>Superclass.prototype._init.call(this)</code> with</strong> in <code>Subclass._init</code> to make sure that the <code>Subclass.prototype</code> gets all the methods/properties of <code>Superclass</code> (which I then add on to in my definition of <code>Subclass.prototype</code>), if the <code>Superclass</code> doesn't have an <code>_init</code> function (i.e. does it have some equivalent constructor function I call)?</li> </ol>  <p>I'm really confused about this all so please forgive me if my question doesn't make much sense; it'll be because of the extent of my misunderstanding &amp; confusion!</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: clarification:  - I know the <code>__proto__</code> is not recommended because it is non-standard, but my code is never going to run in a browser - it's only ever going to run with GNOME javascript (which is basically the Mozilla javascript engine), so I don't need to worry about cross-compatibility.</p> ",

E.g.,</p>  <pre><code>res.render('some-view', { messages: allMessages }); </code></pre>  <p>This should give you something you can iterate over within your view like this:</p>  <pre><code>for message in messages     p(class='alert-#{message.type}') #{message.text} </code></pre> ",

So these two constants represent the numbers you use when converting between angles in degrees and angles in radians.</p></li> <li><p>Looking at the code you've posted, you have the lines to convert <code>latRadians</code> to y.  It looks straightforward to implement code to invert those operations.  You need to 'un'-scale and 'un'-transform 'yScaled'.  For example, treating the line (part):</p>  <p><code>yScaled = ((height / 2.0) - (width * yTransformed / (2 * Math.PI)))</code></p>  <p>as a mathematical equation, you need to solve for <code>yTransformed</code> in terms of <code>yScaled</code>.</p></li> <li><p>As for the Gudermannian, the question you refer to implements that in one line of code and the inverse Gudermannian in 3 lines.  The Gudermannian is just a way of transforming a circular measurement (such as a measurement in degrees or radians) into a linear measurement (such as one in centimetres on a chart to be published on paper).  In particular, and pertinent here, the Gudermannian will transform a latitude into a linear distance from 0.</p></li> </ol>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>OK, so looking a bit closer, in your original code you transform the latitude from an angular measurement into a linear one with the line:</p>  <pre><code>yTransformed = Math.Log(Math.Tan((latRadians / 2) + (Math.PI / 4))) </code></pre>  <p>I think that you should probably replace this with a call to the inverse Gudermannian, as indicated in the answer to the question you link to.

We're actually involving two different   #  variables named 'x'.  One is local to func_B, the other is global.    # By calling func_A(), we do two things: we're reassigning the value   #  of the GLOBAL x as part of func_A, and then taking that same value   #  since it's returned by func_A, and assigning it to a LOCAL variable   #  named 'x'.        x = func_A() # look at this as: x_local = func_A()    # Here, we're assigning the value of 'B' to the LOCAL x.   x = 'B' # look at this as: x_local = 'B'    return x # look at this as: return x_local </code></pre>  <p>In fact, you could rewrite all of <code>func_B</code> with the variable named <code>x_local</code> and it would work identically.</p>  <p>The order matters only as far as the order in which your functions do operations that change the value of the global x.  Thus in our example, order doesn't matter, since <code>func_B</code> calls <code>func_A</code>.  In this example, order does matter:</p>  <pre><code>def a():   global foo   foo = 'A'  def b():   global foo   foo = 'B'  b() a() print foo # prints 'A' because a() was the last function to modify 'foo'. </code></pre>  <p>Note that <code>global</code> is only required to modify global objects.

The global 'x' is untouched. </code></pre>  <p>Note the difference between <code>create_locally</code> and <code>access_only</code> -- <code>access_only</code> is accessing the global x despite not calling <code>global</code>, and even though <code>create_locally</code> doesn't use <code>global</code> either, it creates a local copy since it's <em>assigning</em> a value.</p>  <p>The confusion here is why you shouldn't use global variables.</p> ",

The only obvious duplication is the order in which things are called:</p>  <ol> <li>find an item that we'd like to insert before or after</li> <li>check that the item exists</li> <li>insert the current item before or after it</li> </ol>  <p>You've solved the problem in one way already that basically does these checks. Your solution is however a little unreadable. Here's how I would solve that:</p>  <pre><code>$.fn.moveItem = function(dir){   var index = dir == 'up' ? 0:1,       item = this['getPreviousItem','getNextItem'][index]();   if(item.length){     this['insertBefore','insertAfter'][index].call(this,item);   } } </code></pre>  <p>By using an array index, we can see what is being called when it's being called a little easier than in your example. Also, the use of apply is unnecessary, as you know how many arguments you're passing, so call is better suited to that use case.</p>  <p>Not sure if that's any better, but it's a little shorter (is return false necessary?) and a bit more readable IMO.</p>  <p>In my opinion, centralizing actions is slightly more important than readability - if you want to optimize, change, or append to the action of moving something, you only have to do it in once place. You can always add comments to solve the readability issue.</p> ",

First, there's no need to test every even number; if <code>k &gt; 2</code> and <code>(k % 2) == 0</code>, then <code>k</code> cannot be prime.  So you can eliminate half of the tests by checking explicitly for 2 (prime) or divisibility by 2 (not prime), and then using</p>  <pre><code>for (int i = 3;  i &lt; k;  i += 2) {  // 'i' is the number 'k' is divided by </code></pre>  <p>But you can make this <em>still</em> more efficient, because you can stop after reaching <code>sqrt(k)</code>.  Why?  If <code>k</code> is divisible by some number <code>i</code>, then it must also be divisible by <code>k/i</code> (because <code>i * k/i</code>=<code>k</code>).  And if <code>i &gt; sqrt(k)</code>, then <code>k/i &lt; sqrt(k)</code> and the loop would already have exited.

The compiler will behave as if the lines are concatenated by matching the location of the trailing &amp; with the leading &amp; on the next line.  Since Fortran is happy to ignore spaces between tokens what you have posted is a way of writing a very long statement across a number of source file lines. (OP probably already knows all this, other readers may not.)</p>  <p>The snippet you show is definitely standard-conforming Fortran 90.  The standard defines a trailing &amp; to be the continuation character.  If you want to split either a token (such as a variable name) or a 'character-context' (such as a string literal) across lines then the line onto which the continuation runs must start with an &amp; and there must be no blanks inserted into the sequence of characters after the line-starting &amp;.  I think that what you have posted sneaks into standard-conformity on the grounds that the successive &amp;s might be considered to be not introducing any whitespace into the existing whitespace.</p>  <p>However, the line-starting &amp;s are not required in your snippet.</p>  <p>Your snippet is definitely not standard-conforming fixed-format FORTRAN77.  However, most modern Fortran compilers will, unless you instruct them otherwise, take a relaxed view of this sort of 'not-standard-conforming' but 'obvious-what-is-meant' code and compile it quite happily.  Unless, that is, you try something odd like adding free-format code into an existing fixed-format source file, that's just asking for the compiler to have a hissy fit.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>  <p>My original answer failed to answer OP's question relating to moving the &amp;s into the 73rd column as a tactic for creating code to keep fixed- and free-form compilation happy.  In FORTRAN77 continuation is marked by a character (any character) in column 6 of the continuing line.  That version of the language did not require any character at the end of the line being continued.  Again, I can't see anything wrong with putting an &amp; in column 73.  As OP pointed out in a comment, fixed-form Fortran ignores any characters in col 73-80, and punched cards (ahh, happy days) had only 80 columns.</p>  <p>But I can't see anything to recommend this approach either.  I think that it is far preferable not to mix free- and fixed-form in the same source file.  All the current Fortran compilers will compile both forms in the same compilation.

Liferay by default points to localhost:web/guest/home where they have their login page. On my application i have a different login in page and i want to redirect to the following page. I was browsing the web and found out that by setting <code>auth.login.site.url=/whereiwontittopoint</code> should actualy redirect me there. However it does not. I'm using Liferay  6.0.6 Community Editions. Has anyone done this? Is this the right way or this need to be done with a hook? </p>  <p>My other question is the following. I want to have a custom role on some pages. And i want when a user does not have that specfic role to be redirect to a totaly different page not the default login. I'm fairly sure this can be done by using the hook on some service but for some reason i can not identify this service. </p>  <p>EDIT Ok for the first question i solved the issues. For the second question the answers i got here were not what i was looking for probably because i didn't post the question correctly. This is a full scenario of what i have done and what i need to do:</p>  <p>First of all i changed the /web/guest path that's on every liferay page to web/somthing/ this might not play a crucial role but the problems(some of the problems) started when that happend. THe over all idea is the following. I'm using spring mvc to create the application. I have created a backend to my application from where the admin can create pages for other users to see(This is not done by going to the control panel of liferay and adding a page but through the logic of the application). Once a page is created depending on some logic i create a role for that certain page(customer role also through code not the liferay admin). Some of the users are given this role if the satisfy some criteria and some are not. Here my problem arises, once a user that is loged in to my application tries to access a page (by inputting a direct URL in the browser to the page) that requres the view permision of the role i create for that page and the user does not have the appropriate role he gets redirect to lets say localhost/web/(username)/home a personal page and for some reason on that page by default from liferay he is able to view personal data(user name) of all other users of the application. My question is how through code to handle the redirection that happens of the above scenario.  I have tried on one attempt to actualy hook the servlet.service.events.pre action and before the user access that page to check if he has the appropriate permisions and actualy change his request. So far i have some issues but i can resolve them but this approach is not what i not rly what i am looking for because this action is executed before every single request on the application( and the page handling is just small part of that application) which means i will have a lot of code executing for no reason. I was wondering if there are any ways to add where the exception will redirect when i create the role? If not what action should i hook that will help me solve this scenario but with out the unneeded extrea trafic that i am creating with hooking servlet.service.events.pre action?</p> ",

But in the long run the 'source as text' won. Still you can emulate some of that in many current Lisp environments.

         "\"<h2>The Problem (TL;DR)</h2>  <p>My problem, fundamentally, is that I do not know how OpenGL ES 2.0 expects me to write and use multiple shaders; or if it is even advisable/expected that a person will do so.</p>  <p>The fundamental question here is: if I have an apple, a glowing rock and a fuzzy mesh, all in the same 3D world, all best drawn with different shader programs but using the same mvpMatrix then how would I go about using all of them in the same OpenGL render such that they all use their most appropriate shaders that I have written?</p>  <h2>What Have I done</h2>  <p>So I have written a basic OpenGL ES 2.0 program for my Android Game that works perfectly in that it can draw the outline of the objects to the screen. But it does nothing else; pretty much because the shaders look like this:</p>  <h3>Vertex Shader</h3>  <pre><code>uniform mat4 uMVPMatrix; attribute vec4 aPosition;  void main() {     gl_Position = uMVPMatrix * aPosition; } </code></pre>  <h3>Fragment Shader</h3>  <pre><code>void main() {     gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0); } </code></pre>  <p>Now they are pretty basic. The reason that I have not gone further is because I cannot figure out if I am supposed to write one shader to apply to all of my different objects or if I am supposed to use multiple shaders. And if I am supposed to use multiple shaders to draw multiple different objects then how do I go about doing that in an efficient way?</p>  <p>I get the feeling that this must be basic knowledge to anybody that does OpenGL ES 2.0 day in and day out so I am hoping that somebody can answer my question or point me in the right direction.</p>  <p>I have:</p>  <ul> <li>Looked at multiple tutorials; none of which use anything but the most basic shaders.</li> <li>Read the entire OpenGL ES 2.0 GLSL Spec (none of which mentioned how it was intended to be used; it was just about what everything did rather than how it fits together).</li> <li>Tried to modify my shaders a bit.</li> </ul>  <p>So I'm hoping that I am close to understanding the OpenGL workflow but I don't seem to be there yet. </p>  <p>Edit: I found this well afterwards:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If your application is written for OpenGL ES 2.0, do not create a single shader with lots of switches and conditionals that performs every task your application needs to render the scene. Instead, compile multiple shader programs that each perform a specific, focused task.</p> </blockquote>  <p>That is from the <a href=\"\"http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/Performance/Performance.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008793-CH105-SW11\"\" rel=\"\"noreferrer\"\">iOS OpenGL ES 2.0 guidelines.</a></p> \"",

I am planning to <strong>combine and minify</strong> the files to have fewer requests.</p>  <ol> <li>Would it be a good practice to combine and minify all javascripts necessary on each type of page into one file (and to do the same for css)? e.g. <ul> <li>home page has just one <code>homepage.js</code>,</li> <li>list pages have just <code>listing.js</code>,</li> <li>detail pages have just <code>detail.js</code>,</li> <li>etc.</li> </ul></li> <li>Is it better to combine only those files which are always used together? e.g. <ul> <li><code>jquery.js</code> + <code>jquery.cookie.js</code> + <code>common.js</code>,</li> <li><code>list.js</code> + <code>paging.js</code> + <code>favorite.js</code>,</li> <li><code>detail.js</code> + <code>favorite.js</code>,</li> <li>etc.</li> </ul></li> <li>What about having one file for all javascripts that should load in the head and one file for all javascripts that should load at the end of body, e.g. <ul> <li><code>init.js</code> goes to <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>do.js</code> goes to <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</li> </ul></li> <li>What about having one file for common functions and one for administrative functions which is loaded if the user has specific permissions? </li> <li>Are there any strategies how to balance between 1., 2., 3., and 4.?</li> <li>What is a recommended amount of javascript and css requests for a page?</li> </ol>  <p>I am considering large-scale websites a.k.a. portals or social networks. </p>  <p>(BTW, there are some libraries which requests I can't control, e.g. TinyMCE or google maps).</p> ",

By now, I hope it's clear that Clang is absolutely the way to go when programming, with Clang being the default compiler in the newer versions of Xcode and supporting ARC and new and upcoming language constructs (array and dictionary subscripting, literals, etc.). There's almost absolutely no reason to compile with GCC anymore, and for codebases using ARC and new features, using  plain GCC is no longer relevant or possible (LLVM-GCC may support these features, but it provides no advantage over Clang now that Clang is completely stable).</p>  <hr>  <p>By now (with LLVM-2.0 included in the Xcode 4.0 beta), LLVM is mature enough for production code use. It compiles a little quicker than GCC, and produces faster code, so use it whenever you can (pretty much, try to avoid GCC if something better is available). The standard Xcode 3.2.5 install contains LLVM-1.6 (not the latest), so I'd recommend either running some speed tests to see if there's a noticeable difference between GCC and LLVM, or compiling Clang from source and getting the latest version.</p>  <p>Essentially, there's no need for GCC any more, LLVM + Clang is more than enough.</p> ",

This is working, but i'm not sure if this is the right way.</p>  <p>Another question related to this, i want to use clean urls:</p>  <ul> <li>virtual_exhibitions</li> <li>virtual_exhibitions/themes, virtual_exhibitions/places, ...</li> <li>virtual_exhibitions/themes/love, virtual_exhibitions/places/belgium, ...</li> </ul>  <p>The first one is easy, i can configure this in the views UI. The second one is a bit harder because the categories can have special characters like a ' or a , etc. So i need a raw version (as can be used in path auto) in fact it would be best that my default link of the vocabulary term redirects to this view. because the url of the vocabulary term is very easy to configure using path auto and then i can just use the vocabulary term url in stead of always building it manually.</p>  <p>The reason why i'm using a view for the second level is because it needs a custom layout and as far as i know it isn't possible to style a vocabulary-term of a specific vocabulary. When you style it this style will be used for all the vocabulary-terms.</p>  <p>i hope my description is a bit clear and that somebody can give me some remarks on how i best do this.</p> ",
